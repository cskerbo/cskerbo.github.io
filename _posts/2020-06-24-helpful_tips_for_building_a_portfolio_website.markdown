Most developers will put up a portfolio website at some point in their career path. What better way to show off your skillset than having an entirely blank canvas for you to create to your heart's content?

I recently finished my own portfolio website, and thought I would share a few tips and tricks that might be helpful to others (especially any fellow Flatiron Software Engineering graduates).

## Keep it simple.

Remember this is something you want to show potential employers, and fellow developers who may want to collaborate with you. Don't make it clutttered or hard for them to find the important information like:

* Contact forms or info
* Resume
* Projects you've worked on
* Who you are, and what makes you special

**Make it easy and seamless to learn about and contact you.**

## Show off your skills.

Don't go overboard and be too flashy (unless that's your thing!), but show everyone what you can do. Especially if you're a Full Stack Developer, there are tons of ways you can utilize your skillset:

* Get creative with JavaScript, CSS, Rails and React functionality
* Add CRUD functionality to your site. For example, persist all of your projects in a database and utilize an API to fetch them for your site. As you create additional projects, you can use an Administrative user login to add new projects on the fly!


## Be sure to make your portfolio, and all projects, available to the public.

Getting your builds available to demo is key! Linking to your GitHub code is good practice, but remember that users interacting with your applications can really make an impression on them.

* Utilize services like Heroku and AWS to get your production builds public-facing.
* This is a key part of being Full Stack - employers will appreciate seeing you have experience deploying applications.
* If your application cannot be hosted for some reason, provide a video demo of *you* walking through the application.


## Promote your porfolio site wherever you can.

Be sure to add a link to your portfolio site on all of your social media platforms, your resume, and your cover letters!
